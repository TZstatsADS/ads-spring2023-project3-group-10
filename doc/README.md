### Doc folder

For this project, we mainly use label_cleaning.ipynb and main_models.ipynb. Label cleaning is used to generate 50000 clean lables for images, and the output is under data folder. In main_models.ipynb, we have our baseline logistic model and 2 CNN models. The propose is to find out the best model for image classification.
